## we want to build a production ready UI where we can chat with our agent 

# keep python as backend or use it whenever we want to talk with agent or want to use cloud run api since google has native suport for python. also you can use it whenerv necessary.

# can use any frontend framework of your choice which will can be easily run locally without much install.
# use micorcserviuce arectucture and conatinerise this so i dont have to run or install anything to run this.


# make ui look really good more like having gradient background and modern look or transparent background. 

when agent is reply with code our ui should be able to show it as code not as a text and when agent is giving just normal output then it should be able to show it as normal output. but should be pretty print.

for that you can create a agent whose taks is to just make output pretty print. and decide how to show case it on ui. can maintain this as a small button after clicking it it will get pretty print. with this agent call.
